# webpack-template

A minimal Webpack 5 starter template with CSS support, HTML templating, and separate development/production configurations.

## Features

- **Webpack 5** bundler with ES module config files
- **CSS** — `css-loader` + `style-loader` pipeline for importing CSS into JS
- **HTML** — `html-webpack-plugin` generates the output HTML from a template
- **Dev server** — live-reloading development server via `webpack-dev-server`
- **Split config** — shared base config merged with environment-specific overrides via `webpack-merge`
- **Clean output** — `dist/` is cleaned automatically on every build

```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/feddevv/webpack-template.git
cd webpack-template
npm install
```

## Usage

### Development

Starts a dev server with hot reloading and source maps. The browser opens automatically.

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Mode: `development`
- Source maps: `eval-source-map`
- Watches `src/template.html` for changes

### Production Build

Bundles and minifies the app into the `dist/` directory.

```bash
npm run build
```

- Mode: `production`
- Output: `dist/main.js` + `dist/index.html`
- `dist/` is cleaned before each build

## Configuration

| `webpack.common.js` | Entry point, output path, CSS loader rule, HTML plugin |
| `webpack.dev.js` | Merges common + dev server, source maps |
| `webpack.prod.js` | Merges common + production mode |

## Dependencies

All dependencies are `devDependencies` — there are no runtime dependencies.
